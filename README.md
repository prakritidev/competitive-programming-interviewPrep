# Competitive Programming for Interview Prep
Hi!, Thanks for checking out this repo. I have started competitive programming on Codechef recently. This repo will contain the solution with explanation of the problem so that you can understand what and why I did in my code.

# Pointer for newbies

* If you are new to this and does not have computer science background, I recommend geeksforgeeks.org for building the basics.
* If you are new to this and does have computer science background, I recommend hackerrank for getting hang of this realm.
* If you are experience and lazy to brush your concept, I made a my **practice and notes** folder for you.

# Is there any use of comptetive programming in real world?

**Fuck, NO!**, there is no use of comptetive programming in real world implementation. So why the fuck eveyone is asking questions that are at the same difficulity level of Competitive Programming in the interviews?

Comptetive programming is not desinged for solving real world problems, it's designed for testing the problem solving capability, and that's what you really need in solving real world problems. And that's the reason comptetive programming is so important.

# If I don't do comptetive programming, will I not be able to crack the inteview ?

Hmm, it's not true you can't crack the inteview if you don't do comptetive prgramming. However, it certainly helps you to train your brain muscles.

# When is it too late to start comptetive programming ?

I would say, you don't need do to comptetive prohramming if you have more than 10+ years of experince because by haveing this much experience you already have developed good problem solving skills.

For me, I am just starting now. I was not good at programming in my college days even though I was a CS student. I felt it's not worth investing my time on a problem which dosen't have any use in real life.

I developed a problem solving skill when I started my open source project RESEARCHKERNEL, and now I feel like there is a limit of development when you solve real world problems of programming if I apply time constraints.

What I feel is that Comptetive programming helps you to boost that development and you can develop skill in months that would have taken a year if you are only dependent on solving real-world problems.

# What is my Goal ?

My aim is to get a job of 25+ LPA (Lakhs per annum) within 6 months of preperation and increase my rank in codechef to top 50 worldwide.

If a below average coder like can pull this off, then so can you. But if you are even below than me, well best of luck id al I can say to you.

LETS DO THIS SHIT !!!
